# Linear-Regression---Strokes-Gained-PGA-Tour
Looking at the predictive power of the strokes gained statistics on the PGA Tour using linear regression.

The data used comes from the great dataset provided by Brad Klassen on Kaggle (found here: https://www.kaggle.com/bradklassen/pga-tour-20102018-data), covering many different player statistics over the years 2010-2018. Big thanks to Brad for doing the work in scraping all of the data.
